# Windows Malware Investigation Using Sysinternals

## Objective
Investigate a suspicious executable on a Windows system using the Sysinternals Suite in order to determine malicious behavior, identify persistence mechanisms, and document indicators of compromise.

## Tools Used
Sysinternals Suite (Process Explorer, Autoruns, TCPView) • Windows Event Viewer • VirusTotal • Regedit

## Process
1. Identified unusual CPU and network activity on a Windows VM.
2. Used **Process Explorer** to inspect parent/child processes and verify digital signatures.
3. Flagged a suspicious executable with high entropy and no valid certificate.
4. Executed **Autoruns** to locate persistence via `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
5. Used **TCPView** to capture unexpected outbound connections to a foreign command-and-control (C2) server.
6. Submitted the binary hash to VirusTotal — confirmed multiple detections.
7. Terminated malicious process, removed persistence keys, and isolated the compromised VM.
8. Recorded all IOCs and behavior patterns for future alert tuning.

## Key Findings
- Malicious executable created persistence in Run keys.
- Outbound traffic to suspicious remote IPs.
- Obfuscated code behavior consistent with trojan loaders.

## Artifacts
- `sysinternals-findings.txt`  
- `registry-persistence.txt`  
- `ioc-list.csv`  
- `/screenshots/` (upload later)

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- **T1059 – Execution**  
- **T1547.001 – Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder**  
- **T1071 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**
